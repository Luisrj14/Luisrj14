<h3>Hi there 👋, I'm Luis R Jimenez A.</h3>

- I have a master’s degree in Materials, Nanophysics, and Quantum Technology from the University of Oslo, with a focus on computational physics. My thesis focused on point defects for quantum technology applications, using computational tools.
- I'm trying to get more involved in open-source projects, mainly in the Python community, to learn, improve, and help others along the way.
- I'm intersting in
  - Quantum technologies
  - Quantum chemistry 
  - Semiconductor physics 
  - Many-body quantum mechanics
  - Computational physics 
  - Machine learning and IA
  - Sofware development
- I’m open to working on any kind of research project in my field of interest, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.
